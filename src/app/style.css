src/app/style.css

Lightweight app styling.

Design goal:
- Keep styling minimal and readable for a school project.
- Avoid fragile selectors so upgrades to Streamlit won’t break the layout.

Inputs:
- Loaded by app.py via an injected <style> tag.

Outputs:
- Slightly improved spacing and typography.
